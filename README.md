##  **Project Summary**
This project integrates **The Washington Post’s Fatal Force dataset (2015–2024)** with **U.S. Census Bureau socioeconomic indicators (2024 ACS)** to examine how **income, poverty, education, and racial composition** correlate with **police-involved fatalities** at the city level.  
The analysis includes:

- SQL-based data warehousing and indexing  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization  
- Machine learning modeling (linear and ensemble methods)  
- Insights highlighting socioeconomic disparities across U.S. cities
