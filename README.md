## 🚀 **Recommended Execution Order**

| Step | Module | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | **Census Data Collection** | Retrieve and clean Census socioeconomic data |
| 2 | **SQL Data Warehouse** | Create SQLite database and load merged tables |
| 3 | **Data Analysis with Python** | Perform data wrangling and exploratory analysis |
| 4 | **Visualization with Python** | Visualize socioeconomic trends and correlations |
| 5 | **Machine Learning Model** | Train and evaluate regression & random forest models |
| 6 | **API (Optional)** | Automate Census data retrieval |

##  **Project Summary**
This project integrates **The Washington Post’s Fatal Force dataset (2015–2024)** with **U.S. Census Bureau socioeconomic indicators (2024 ACS)** to examine how **income, poverty, education, and racial composition** correlate with **police-involved fatalities** at the city level.  
The analysis includes:

- SQL-based data warehousing and indexing  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization  
- Machine learning modeling (linear and ensemble methods)  
- Insights highlighting socioeconomic disparities across U.S. cities
